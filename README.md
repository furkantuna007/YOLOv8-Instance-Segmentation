# YOLOv8-Instance-Segmentation - Fruit Detection

Aim of the project is to apply instance segmentation using new version of You Only Look Once (YOLOv8) algorithm to classify three different fruit types: Watermelon, blackberry and pineapple. The
images which has been used are created using data augmentation (rotating and noise) for improve the robustness of the model.
